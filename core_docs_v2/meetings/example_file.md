0:00 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Hello, are okay? Yeah.

0:04 - Zain Gul
  I think I'm ready.

0:06 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  I'm all good, all good.

0:08 - Zain Gul
  I look forward to seeing, how was your time off, your holiday?

0:13 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  My holiday, yeah, that was great. Yeah, that's good, that's good.

0:19 - Zain Gul
  I've been using Flutter as well, so I'm excited to see how you guys, what you guys, did you guys get the UI documentation and the brand kit?

0:32 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Not yet, we're waiting for that. Oh, I thought it was sent over.

0:39 - Zain Gul
  Okay, no problem. Hopefully that should be sent over in this meeting, to be honest. That's already all done. All the choices and decisions have been answered and made.

0:50 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Yeah, that is the important thing, the agenda of this meeting, because it's delaying our progress. Yeah.

0:59 - Zain Gul
  Yeah. That should be sent to you immediately to be fair. It's all ready. Every question was answered and visualized as well.  Hello, Michael. Hello.

1:14 - Michael Antonio
  How are you? All good.

1:16 - Zain Gul
  All good. Just catching up with you.

1:19 - Michael Antonio
  Hello. Hello.

1:23 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  How are you? Yeah, I'm doing well. Very well. Is it cold out there? Very. Yeah. It's cold.

1:34 - Michael Antonio
  Good afternoon.

1:36 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Good afternoon.

1:36 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Oh, we've got Batman with us. That's really on. love it. Hey, Zain. I'm warm. I'm okay. I'm okay. Yes, you're okay.

1:46 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Good, good, Yeah, everything is working fine. Excellent. Excellent.

1:51 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  We're looking forward to today because I think last week we had it over. I thought it was holiday last week and you were still working, Subashis.  You were like asking for these. Yes, we are like that only.

2:03 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Sometimes when we get time, we do our painting tasks so that we don't fail behind. No, no, that's amazing.

2:11 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  That's great. But yeah, so perfect. I mean, we hope last week's mock server helped you a lot. Was there any issues or anything you wanted to discuss from last week's mock server?

2:27 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Most of the things are working fine. And I have implemented them as well into the UI. Yeah. Most of the parts.  Yeah. Just a minute. Let me open up. Who is joining? Okay. Uh, I am following our internal structure, let me show you.  So, this is the timeline of the project, according to the functional specification and the agreement. So, these are the things that are done from our site.  Yeah. Uh, dashboard layout, widgets. Uh. Customizable widgets, responsive design for UI, and then settings of implementation. Most of the means we are going according to the timeline.  The things which are not done yet, it is pending from the backend side. This was also implemented using the provided JWT token.
  ACTION ITEM: Send Firebase access details to Subashis. Incl. auth setup, staging/prod server info.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/nSiCKXRGg6AEpwzuE-hTeUV9mkzzuuJt?timestamp=262.9999

4:30 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Okay.

4:33 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  So if we get the Firebase access, and if there are anything multi-factor authentication, then we can implement them as well.  Perfect.

4:46 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Yeah, we just finished that last week. So just implementing that on my real servers this week. So we'll get that to you very, very soon.  Just a reminder, we're doing it. So it's going to be nice and straightforward for the Flutter app. And then, of course, when we're linking it to our FastAPI app, hosted on Google Cloud, we'll implement the setup on Firebase directly anyway.  So it's going be quite straightforward. And one other thing as well, just as an update for yourself too. Now, originally, we were working according to the plan.  And this doesn't change anything for you. It's just information. Originally, we were working to the plan of using Google's integration with 100 users, the test authentication.  But we've just done some more research. And we should be able to apply. And we are in the process of applying for the verified application status from Google, which means we'll have unlimited user access to our Google logins, which means we're going to be, hopefully, from our end anyway, we're going to be able to go to live very soon.  So it won't just be restricted to 100 users. Hopefully, we should be able to do it a lot more.  More than that. So that's just something that I wanted to update you on. But we would still need, you know, the sign-in process of, later on we'll discuss this I guess, but when someone needs to set up an account, you know, we'll probably know them manually anyway, but we'll just send them to the web app and say sign up over here.  They can write their email address in, they can write their password in, and they can request, or they can even just, you know, type their email address in, and we can manually set them up.  So, at this moment in time, for the 100 users, there's going to have to be a manual setup anyway, because we'll have to add them to the list of approved users.  But hopefully when we get to that stage where we're verified, we're hoping within six weeks, that should just be an automated process, fingers crossed.  Yep.

6:46 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  And I think Kaj just joined. Yeah, no problem with that, because the mostly the load will be on the backend.

6:55 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Exactly, yeah, it's just the frontend needs to maybe just change, maybe one. Maybe we'll have to remove that page, the registration page, because instead of registration, it will have to go directly to the, I mean, we're going to decide free trial, so it'll be either free trial or it'll be, I mean, it's just a signup page that we need to decide what will happen, because once that's verified, we'll have to change the signup page, basically.
  ACTION ITEM: Send UI designs, brand kit to Subashis via new email. Incl. all finalized UI elements.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/nSiCKXRGg6AEpwzuE-hTeUV9mkzzuuJt?timestamp=433.9999
  ACTION ITEM: Email new company addresses (infinitylink.ai) for team to Subashis. Incl. Zain, Michael, Kaj.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/nSiCKXRGg6AEpwzuE-hTeUV9mkzzuuJt?timestamp=450.9999

7:23 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Yeah. So, I was talking with Zain about the front-end UI, the requirement we have sent. Is there any update?  Yes, there is update. We've done a lot of work on it, so I'm going to, I was just checking through the work that we've done, so I'm going to send that over to you by today, for sure.

7:41 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  We've got a whole brand kit that Zain's created, and we've got some other things as well that I've added on, so I'm just going to email that across to you.  And I also wanted to update you that we've got a new email address now, so I know you're sending things to my email address, but I'll just text you on the link on the WhatsApp group as well.  So, it's azim at infinitylink.ai. So we're going to start putting everything on there from now on, and infinitylink.ai is going to be our main domain for everything, including Firebase and everything too.  So that's where you're going to receive my emails from going forward. So I'll just send you this new email from there too, and for any future invitations, if you can send the invitations to that email as well.  There's one for Zain, there's one for Michael as well, and one for Kaj. So I'll send you a list for everyone's emails in a new email too.  Okay, that's really great.

8:36 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  So we have these dependencies, and for the next development, WebSocket real-time, this is also depending on the backend. Yeah.  By when we can expect these accesses? Yes, I mean. Like we are already ahead of the timeline. Exactly. We're ahead of that.  We on this part. Yeah, that's what I'm so happy about because now that we...

9:00 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  We've the Firebase hopefully set up as well. We're going to send that over to you. But what we wanted to do was really, I'll send you all the finalized UI things as well.  Is there, I mean, what I was hoping to do for this week, and I'm being a bit ambitious here, but I was hoping to, we've got our prototypes all ready to go.  So I'm converting that into our, you know, FastAPare backend system fully. And we want to make sure that, of course, you've got the mock server, but then in reality, all you need to do is change, you know, where you're sending the calls, because it'll be very similar or the same, and it'll have real data once the user login is created as well.  So technically, if I do everything correctly this week, we could have our whole backend system set up with the Gmail integration and with the calendar integration and with the AI system set up by this week, fingers crossed.  And we were hoping to maybe see some UI elements from yourself as well. So technically, if we do this correctly, we could have the first step, you know, live within this.  This week, just without full functionality, but at least with the functionality that you've created and the functionality that we have as well.  So I'm just wondering from your side, is there anything that you can present from the UI aspect or is it still in progress?  UI means are you talking about design or the Flutter app?

10:20 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Yeah, the actual Flutter app as well.

10:22 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  So like the login screen, you know, is it working with the mock server at the moment?

10:25 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  I'm sure. Yeah.

10:31 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  I mean, yeah, sorry, UI wise, we can change that across because I'll send you the designs and stuff, but it's just the functionality.  This is just to work with the logic.

10:44 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Yeah. Nothing else. Perfect. This is just the dashboard and it's showing the mock data. Yeah. Beautiful. This is the mock data.  And Michael, do you recognize the emails?

11:00 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Sorry, could you be there? Do you recognize the mobile data as well? Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. That's great. These are all the chats and emails and travel.  Cool, cool.

11:10 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Yeah. Recognize Alice Smith from Q4. Is that your name?

11:19 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  And there's just an update, you know, just depending on the Google authentication, we might be making some redactions. We might be removing this email feature, potentially, just for now.  We've not confirmed it yet, but depending on what Google says, because we might not be storing emails directly, we might just be referring to the Gmail link, because that's a new addition, because it just saves on storage for now.  And also, it might actually help with our verification process. But we'll still, like I said, we'll still have this feature available as a premium feature in the future, for sure.  So much of this is done means...

11:59 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  I... I have implemented even the search feature as well. Even the what, sorry? Search feature. This is great.

12:07 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  And we're going to potentially use this as a premium feature because, you this is going to require more storage for certain clients as well.  So this is great because imagine the idea is in the future, like they can integrate their Gmail account, their other email accounts, and they have like a full-blown, you know, unified email with AI systems on it as well, which is a really good thing because I think, Zain, you're going to tell us when you find your research that other companies are not doing this as well because they're not actually storing email.  So this is going to be like a premium feature, but we can, we can, these are, these are discussions we're going to have later on, you know, it's just something I wanted to share with you now.  That's great. Ideally, ideally what we want to do then is, you know, we've got the functionality and we've got the mock server, we've got the front end, we'll have the UI updates sorted.  I'm going to create everything on our Firebase end as well and make sure it's all integrated with the. AI systems.  And if we can then send you the new, the real API gateway, basically, then, because we're also applying some of the security aspects.  So if we send that new server to you, the staging server, basically, then it looks like we'll be one step closer to production, and we can have that functional prototype, hopefully, or proof of concept ready by this week.  Like I said, we've got one real email, you know, like we've got a test real email that can log in with Gmail.  It's got 50,000 emails in it, and we would love to just test it properly with that one. And once we figure out that everything is perfect, we can then go on to the next steps.  If you can go back to your, back to your list of things to do, the roadmap. Just a minute.

13:55 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Okay. Thank you.

14:04 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Yeah, so for phase one, I mean, literally, like, if you can just go up a little bit. So we'll have the Firebase sent to you in no time ASAP.  Use the profiles and settings foundations, that's some more work to do. Multi-factor authentication as well, it's going to be part of the Firebase system.  Biometric, I guess that's on your side, isn't it, really? But then that's more for the mobile aspect, right? So whenever you're doing the mobile phone, I'll go in time in line with that.  Yeah, and I think, yeah, the design aspect will send to you ASAP as well. So local storage, again, I guess that's more to do with your sort of mobile aspect as well.  That's great. Widget customization, tool to refresh. Okay, cool. So, mean, we're almost there with phase one. And, I mean, the main one I've not really noticed anywhere is really the Gmail integration.  So we want to make sure the Gmail integration. The is correct, and the calendar integration is correct. This one, right?

15:04 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Google Out.

15:06 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  So no, this one, from what I understand, we're talking about Google. So just to clarify, when a person logs into the account, they'll log in through a username and password or even a Google account.  It's completely their choice. It could even be a different type of account. But when they log in, they can then afterwards also choose which emails they want to integrate into the platform.  So if they want to log in with their, at the moment, we're only supporting Google, that's fine. But they could log in with two or three different Google accounts, depending on the, you know, what we're charging them.  So there's two steps there. There's one step, which is just for authentication. And the second step, which you don't need to worry about because it's going to handle, be handled by the backend system.  It's for their login. At the moment, we're limiting it to one user account per user, just to keep it, you know, simple.  But in the future, they could add like three, four, five emails and we can charge them per email or something.  Okay. Okay. So there's two different aspects here. That one doesn't involve Firebase. That one just is the Google O'Wars.  So Google O'Wars is separate to Firebase. Okay. Just so you're aware whenever we discuss it. And then obviously Calendar as well.  So we want to make sure that the Gmail and Calendar aspects are there and then they are connected directly to our AI system.  You know, that can really help the user find and do whatever they want to do. We are not at this moment in time interacting directly again with Google systems.  So we're not sort of sending emails from our AI system. We're probably going to be creating drafts. We're probably going to be creating, well, we are definitely creating events in our own calendar, but not in the Google Calendar.  So we're not communicating backwards. We're only receiving information. So I think all that should be part of phase, is that going to be part of phase one?  Or is that related to phase two? That's just one thing I wanted to check. Because phase two seems a bit more...  Or about the AI systems and WhatsApp, is that correct? Cause phase two is really just the AI systems that we're talking about.  The WebSocket, AI integration, the push system.

17:17 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Yeah, so you're talking about the Gmail, right? Yeah, the emails. Yeah, so that should be phase one. I think this one you're talking about.  So this is more related to integration with conflict detection, email settings, and sync configuration. Yeah. IMPA.

17:41 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Yeah, I think- And this email. Yeah, this is the more polished one, which is great. But if we go back to phase one really quickly, I think what's important is now that we are the foundation and the authentication systems are going to be sorted, we're to have the server set up, we're going to have a staging server and production system,  So we've got a mock server just for the API system, which is great to test that with, and we'll keep that live and updated and keep on testing it through there.  But then we're going to give you the real system, you know, on staging, and we're going to have a proper integration to it as well.  And with that one, what we wanted to do, because we've already done this work, we want to create the whole setup page for, you know, when someone logs in, they log in, and then they have, like, a set of wizard or something, like we've discussed, you where they can actually integrate their email.  They don't necessarily, they don't have to log in with Google, right? They can log in with their email and username and password.  And then once they're on the integration page, email integration page, they just say, you know, at the moment, you can only sign in with Google.  So they go to the click, you know, to click the link for integrating their Google account. That then takes them to the page that we've created, know, the Michael, the work that you've done for integrating.  Or signing in with the Google Awards, allowing permissions for our FastAPI app, which we'll have to name all correctly, for that to have access to the Google account.  So that is going to be like a click link that goes to another web page, right? Because you can't, from what I understand, you can't do that as an iframe.  So you'd have to do that on Google's own page. We'll have to double check that, because if it's iframe, it might be better.  Or if it's a pop-up, it might be better. But whatever the system is, it can always return us back to the app directly.  So once that's signed in, it will return us back to the app. Now, on your end, there should just be an animation, like a sync is in progress or something.  And then it should just check with the FastAPI app and say, OK, has the sync started yet? Has it completed yet?  And what we'll do, and these are going to be like new API requests, because we've not created those things yet.  We're not at that level. That should have been something on our end. But the idea is, once that sync is in progress, imagine there's a thousand units.  It just updates you that, oh, we've synced 100 emails, we've synced 200 emails, there's about 10 minutes left or something.  It's going to be a queue process, right? So this is a system that we are using as a microservice data because there's going to be so many users doing this.  But for the front end, for the Flutter app, there needs to be a process where, you know, this is understood by the user so they know the sync is taking place and the emails are getting integrated, the calendar is getting integrated, and it will take maybe 10 minutes or whatever the time is, and they can check back.  And then once it's done, the user has a notification saying, look, the email has been integrated, you're ready to use it, and then we can go from there.  So that's the step I was hoping we would do in, like, phase one or phase two, because once that's done, you know, I think that is more important than integrating the AI system because we can integrate the AI system, but with that data, it's useless.  So the data has to come first. So phase two should really be about email integration and the calendar integration.

21:08 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  I hope that makes sense. Yeah. So the thing is, the timeline we have created here, it will not conflict with the things we are planning now, because whatever you will be creating in the backend, we will parallel integrate with the frontend and also keeping this timeline.  So there will be no conflict. That's great. That's awesome.

21:34 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Awesome. Okay, cool. But that's just what we want to focus on. So that's really what we're trying to get done as well from our end.  So just to summarize then, we'll be setting all those things up on our end. We'll be sending you the details for the Firebase.  We'll be sending you the details for the GitHub and for the new server as well. And yeah, we'll be hosting on our systems as well.  So we'll send you access to... you. Thank So basically everything that we've listed down on the previous documentation, we'll send you the UI systems as well, and from your end, is there anything more left to do?  Is there anything else you can work on? mean, the mobile app system, you're going to work on, I mean, the authentication, biometric authentication, everything, are you going to be working on that later?
  ACTION ITEM: Implement settings page design, widget customization in Flutter app.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/nSiCKXRGg6AEpwzuE-hTeUV9mkzzuuJt?timestamp=1336.9999  And what's the next steps for yourself while we're sending all this to you?

22:27 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  I will be working, we'll be working on this setting hub implementation, the setting page design, and this widget customization.  And if these are done, and still the access is pending from your side, then we will move to the next page.  Perfect, perfect.

22:52 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  just, yeah, that's great. And just remember, the AI system will come after the email and Gmail integration, and we just want to get that finalized.  And then because we're doing a lot of work for our data management systems in the back end. But yeah, you're right.  We can work on this parallel because we can create the chatbot to make sure that it does send the request back and forth.  And once that's done, we can even add that to the mock server, Michael, so that we just have these requests recorded and we have like fake requests or fake responses sent back so that at least it's functional from a UI perspective.  But just to let you know as well, we'll be moving that mock server to our internal Google platform as well.  So once that's done, we'll obviously, before it's done, we'll update you and we'll keep both of them live until you're ready as well.  One question from my site.

23:44 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  This is not related to development. This is, is there any specific reason that you have chosen the Google Workspace over Microsoft Workspace?  Yeah, yeah, because you mean, you mean for the, for the whole server system?

24:00 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Or just for Google emails?

24:03 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  No, the Gmail means the first feature we're providing, the Gmail feature into our app, not Outlook. Is there any specific reason for that?  Yeah, yeah.

24:17 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  So when we were doing all the research, firstly, you know, the idea came from Kieran. So it was one of his, you know, problems that he was trying to solve.  And when we talk to everyone in the UK, the Gmail is one of the most popular ones. Outlook is popular for sure, but it's less popular than Gmail, right?  So a lot of people are using in the UK, Gmail more than they're using Outlook.

24:41 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  So this is very much. Most of the people who will be using this app, according to my understanding, they will be using for their professional purposes.  Well, not straight away, not straight away.

24:57 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  So at the moment in time, we're talking to businesses, definitely large enterprises. Bye. Bye. They use Microsoft quite a lot, but we're not at that step yet.  We're only at the step where we're talking to small startups. We're talking to medium-sized businesses. So from everyone that we're focusing to target in the first three to six to nine months, it's going to be Gmail-focused.  We have got Outlook as well on the horizon after Gmail. We definitely want to do that. The idea is we want to prove the system because ideally we only wanted 100 users because Gmail restricted us to 100 users.  We basically have 100 users ready to go. Once we have this system set up, we're definitely going to do Outlook as well.  That's definitely on the horizon. Okay.

25:40 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  But yeah, I know what mean. And another question besides this, how many team members are working on the FastAPI backend from your team?  Say that again. It means how many team members from your team is committed for the FastAPI backend? So So  Michael, Zain, and myself.

26:02 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  So we're all working on different aspects of the system. So we're all three of us working on the backend system.  Now, if you're asking who's working on the Google side of the things, like the actual staging server and production server, that's myself.  I'm just creating all the things at the moment. Michael and Zain are working on the test servers as well.  So there's a lot of things that we're doing, but is there a reason you wanted to ask? Do you want to ask very specific questions about the servers, or is it just curiosity?
  ACTION ITEM: Send backend architecture details to Subashis. Incl. Firebase auth, FastAPI setup, Google integration.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/nSiCKXRGg6AEpwzuE-hTeUV9mkzzuuJt?timestamp=1585.9999

26:30 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Ah, means this is just curiosity, if you need any help. Oh, say, you know, of course, yeah.

26:36 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  We did want to actually ask for some advice, maybe, because what we're doing with the Firebase authentication, and I mean, we've solved it already.  And what we'll do, actually, we'll share that with you as to the authentication system that we're using and the architecture that we're using, because obviously it's important for you to understand how the backend is working as well.  And if you've got any suggestions from that point of view, do let us know, because from our point of view, the reason we're doing it this  This way is because we don't want to create a monolith, right? We don't want to just create a massive Flutter app because FastAPI is what's been recommended by every head of the organization I've met, you know, with AI companies as well.  So those things and, of course, Google's own internal tech stack, the reason we're using that is because we want to get verified by Google.  And, again, this is answering your question about why we're not using Outlook because this idea, this startup is directly from, you know, solving the problem of Kieran.  He had these problems with his own Gmail accounts. And, again, Gmail is very popular with the audience we're targeting straight away.  So all of this stemmed from that idea. You know, Outlook is definitely on the look and so is the ability to, you know, implement any other suggestions you have.  But the idea is we want to really move fast. We want to make sure that in the next, hopefully, the next six weeks, we get Google's verification sorted.  And if we're verified and if. From your end, we have the Flutter app, web app, we have authentication systems sorted, if we have Gmail integration and Cal integration sorted, you know, we're at quite a good level, as well as the AI system, because then we can actually start the users, we can actually get them to use the system.  Of course, we might need some further guidance on, like, cyber security, you know, because we, that's where we lack, we're obviously using standard, you knowledge that we have, but I've read so much more about certain AI agents, you know, there's actually more cyber security issues in AI agents themselves, you know, I don't know if you've heard, but there's like, particularly with emails, people are now sending emails, right, on purpose to email addresses, because they know people are using AI agents like ours, so they are injecting prompts into emails, so when our AI agents read the emails, they are probably going to get tricked into doing  Certain things they shouldn't do, right? So these are the kinds of things that we've been learning and we've been implementing security solutions.  And of course, this is why we're using Google, because all of these implementations, all of the security is already standard on Google.  They're the ones that are telling us about it. So we'll definitely talk with you about the architecture and the setup that we've done, because of course, it's like a black box to you at the moment.  But any suggestions you have, any recommendations you have, of course, we'll appreciate your advice on that too. Yeah, so this is because of only we're doing the MVP.

29:36 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Later, we might sit and discuss about it. I myself am system architect. So we can discuss about the tech stack and what are the components we can hand over to different stacks.  But these are on the later period.

29:53 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Getting to MVP is our priority. We want to get there as fast and as safe as possible. And then once we're at MVP, MVP, we can get...  Get more funding, and we can then say, okay, now we're MVP, we've got these many users, we want to get to 10x the users, what do we need to do to make it safer, to make it better, you know, to make it faster?  Efficiency is going to be key, because I can see straight away that, you we're going to be using a lot of resources, so it's going to be quite costly from the way we're doing things.  And we are building for scale, but yeah, there's a different level of architecture, as you're aware as well, right, when it goes from, you know, 10 years.  It 1,000 to 10,000 to 100,000, so there's going to be different things that happen, the queues that we need, you know, the kind of rate limits that we need to implement, the restrictions from Google directly, you know, with all these different calls happening, the encryption systems, the premium features versus the non-premium features, there's not storing emails and storing emails, how do you check the logs when you've already deleted the emails, you you don't have access to the user emails, so there's all this type of stuff that can go wrong.  That we'll need to plan out and prepare for. But that's a good problem to have. That means we've become a successful company, right?  But right now, we've got realizing from zero to one, and we're trying to get there as quick as possible, as safely as possible.

31:15 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Sure. Great. Somnath, do you want to add anything? Yes, I'm not.

31:26 - Somnath Jana
  Your mic is muted. Yeah, sorry. Sorry. So, I need some information. So, have you gave us that, could you please give us that, all the details?  Yeah, the documents, yeah. I'll be sending that across to you.

31:43 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  We've also, like I said, got some more details as well. So, again, we were just checking through everything. But today, I'll send that to you.  And then, hopefully, you can have access to that and go from there. Was there anything else apart from those things that you needed?  I think if you could provide it by

32:01 - Somnath Jana
  So today or tomorrow, then it will be really great. Yeah, I'll get that sort of. After the email. Yeah.  Perfect.

32:07 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Michael, Zain, any questions for Subashis or anyone else? Not right now, no. Okay. Well done, Michael. Your mock server system, there's no complaints so far.  Subashis said almost everything is working. He's not told us what's not working. Yeah, what is not working?

32:23 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  That's good. We'll have to add more things later.

32:25 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  As we said, you know, when we're integrating the Gmail accounts, we'll have to have the whole, what do we call it, the progress feature, so that the animations can work and that there can be that kind of notification feature as well.  It'd have to be the PubSub as well. We'll have to add all these things, and this is why I'm thinking it's going to be part of phase two.  So even before the AI systems are on board, how do we get that integration process sorted with the calendar and emails?  And, of course, the premium feature versus the non-premium feature, which is going to be storing emails versus not storing emails.  But now that we've got the system for storing emails, and we've got the UI, we'll stick to the premium feature.  For now, and then we can always remove it or disable it until necessary, but if Google authorizes it, then perfect, you know, we're ready to go.  Zain, any questions at all? No questions. You normally have like 23 questions, no? I liked one. It was really nice to see the UI and what they're working on.

33:24 - Zain Gul
  Great, guys.

33:24 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  we've got a lot of work to do to make it live, and if we can get these three things done, we can get the UI center across the Zotosomna so we can work on that stuff.  And I'm hoping, I mean, was being a bit ambitious about this week, but maybe by next week we can have some functional aspects and the week after the AI systems can start taking shape and we can have some more accuracy.  And about three weeks after that, we can have hopefully Google's authentication and then we can be out there in the world, fingers crossed, as long as I said cyber security is correct.  And I think, Sebastian, that's maybe where we'll need some guidance about. will for that. He's just checking up on all  Just penetration testing and all these kind of different systems where we don't really want to go over and aboard.  We want to definitely get certifications, and we're working on those from the UK to get those certifications. But any real-world scenarios where you can give suggestions about, for example, blocking certain, I don't know, having some sort of rate limits or having whatever else, you know, the OWASP systems as well, just testing all those things out.  But whatever automated tests you guys use, if you can guide us on that too, so we can have regular testing on our systems.  And even, like I said, the encryption side of things, we want to make sure that we're using the best in class systems that are not too expensive.  And, of course, for API as well, the whole system is based with API calls. We've got some, I mean, we're thinking about Apigee from Google to work with that basically as well.  But I've got some more recommendations from other companies, some free trials as well. But any recommendations you have, guys, as well, this is the perfect time to share it because we don't want to.  Just build, you know, like a monolith, like I said, or even our own greenfield project. If there are already API, you know, solutions out there that add security and logs and everything, the API gateway, basically, then we'll use that instead as well.
  ACTION ITEM: Send current tech stack details to Subashis. Incl. libraries, monitoring, code quality tools, AI usage, project structure.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/nSiCKXRGg6AEpwzuE-hTeUV9mkzzuuJt?timestamp=2109.9999  Yep.

35:20 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  So we can discuss about that. For that, I would require the current text tag you are using. Text tag means the libraries you are using.  Yeah. What are the monitoring system? And what are the checker for code quality you are using? And if you are using AI or something else for the code generation and the structure of the folder, the project structure.  Yes. I mean, we're also thinking. And which specific methodology you are following, MBB, MBB, microservices. Yeah. So if you can get, send it over to me.  In the next meeting, I can give you some insight. Oh, beautiful. I love that.

36:06 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  I love that. I was thinking this will take three, four weeks, but you're ready for the next meeting. That's great.  No, that's great. We'll get on that ASAP. And that just brings me to the last question. When shall we have the next meeting?  Because we've got a lot of work to do. And I don't think we need a meeting. If we can try to send all the stuff across to you, I'll send it through the new email.  But shall we say, let me just check my calendar and our calendars as well. If you guys could, you could check your calendars.  I don't think we should do one on Friday because we've just had one today. And I don't think we should do one next Monday, but we can stay in touch by email because we've got lots of work to do.  If we say the 17th for now, how is that for everyone?

36:55 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  For now, there is no problem. For now, you are signing off. All the things over through the email, we can handle that.  Perfect.

37:06 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Yeah, we've got a lot of work to do. I think this week and a half is the key time where we're going to implement all the solutions.  We're going to send the UI things as well. We're going to make the decisions for everything. And then hopefully by next 17th, we can start really seeing it take shape.  And like you said, we're already ahead, which is great. I think if we need to have a meeting for the Firebase authentication, we can.  But like we'll send everything across by email and hopefully it'll just work. Everything should work quite well. I'll create like a password sharing system as well.  So we can have all the passwords there as well as required. Okay.

37:44 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  So you are sending the creates, Creates means the information. Exactly. The wordpress access. Exactly.

37:54 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Yeah, we'll be sending you all the access to everything. I mean, even Michael and Zain don't have it yet.  Yeah, you know, they've got to do 10 press-ups to go. The password. So let's see. They can do it.  But no, we'll be sending everything across to you guys. And yeah, there's a lot of work to do, which is why I think we should only have the meeting on the 17th.  And by that time, all of our work should be compiled. And we should be at a good level. And it should be quite usable, I hope.

38:22 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Okay, great. I appreciate your time, Tim. That's great. So should we say you have a good, very great.

38:33 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Yeah, should we say at 2.30, would you be able to send that invitation? And if you don't mind, if you could send that invitation to if I just write in chat, where's chat gone over here?  So it's azeem at infinity link.ai. So that's my email. And then for Zain, it's just Zain for Michael, Michael, and for Katz.  So if you could just send that across, or even just send it to me, I'll send that across to all of them.  And that would be great. And then we'll just be communicating from there directly.
  ACTION ITEM: Send project timeline document to Azeem. Incl. phases, tasks, deadlines.
 - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/nSiCKXRGg6AEpwzuE-hTeUV9mkzzuuJt?timestamp=2360.9999

39:18 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Yeah, I have added you, you can add them as well. Awesome, that's great.

39:23 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  All right, guys, so 2.30 on the 17th, and hopefully before then, if we need to, we can. But we've got this massive sprint of work to do.  Subashis, would you be able to send that document, actually? Because I've not seen that one, just so I can have it in my, it's the whole to-do list you had, just so I can have it in my zone as well.

39:41 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Document means the timeline you're seeing? The timeline, yeah.

39:44 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  I didn't see the specific, that one before, so that'd be good to just have a look at. Yeah, yeah, sure.

39:49 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Great. All right, guys, Kaj, any questions at all?

39:55 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  Nope.

39:56 - Caj Shusee
  Not zone, so everything's all good. Awesome. All right, guys?

40:01 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  I will catch you soon. Michael and Zain, we'll catch up. Caj, going to catch up straight after this? Yes.

40:08 - Caj Shusee
  Cool, cool. Let's catch up straight after this. All right, guys.

40:10 - Azeem Sayani (sayani.uk)
  See soon.

40:13 - Subashis  Guchait (Insightstap)
  Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you.
